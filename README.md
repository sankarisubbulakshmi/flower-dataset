## Plant Characteristics Dataset

## Overview
The Plant Characteristics dataset provides information on various plant species, including their size, fragrance, and height. This dataset can be used for analysis of plant features and their characteristics.

## Data Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

species: The species of the plant (e.g., rose, shoeblack plant, hibiscus)
size: The size of the plant (e.g., medium, large)
fragrance: The fragrance of the plant (e.g., mild, none)
height_cm: Height of the plant in centimeters

## Data Source
This dataset is sourced from Kaggle. For more information, you can visit the Kaggle dataset page.

## Supervised/Unsupervised
This dataset can be used for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. For supervised learning, it could be used to predict plant characteristics such as height based on features like size and fragrance. For unsupervised learning, it could be used for clustering plants into groups based on their characteristics.
